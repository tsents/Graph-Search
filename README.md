This is a solver for subgraph isomorphism (induced and non-induced) problems.

Compiling

You need golang 1.22.3

``
$ go build -o output_name 
``

Testing

``
$ go test
``

Runs tests on gnps, with very low probability a test would fail (because there are random graphs), thus sometimes rerunning can verify the result.

Running

To run:
``
$ ./output_name i j 
``

will find subgraph isomorphisms of graphj.json inside graphi.json, given the ordering ordering_i_j.json

Outputs to directory "dat/"

And expectes inputs to be inside "inputs/"

We use python 3 for the python scripts, these were created along the way to help formatting, and create the ordering.
To create an ordreing the simplest way is to use new_script with the full_pipeline() function. that takes input graphs as json files, parses them to networkx,
from that creates our optimal ordering, and outputs that into an appropriate json file.

File Format

For the graphs: node - link data json file (like the one generated by networkx), and only numerical values. node id's - uint32, color id's - uint16.
For the ordering: {ordering : []} json where the array is an the choice for v1,v2... the ordering should be non - empty. but more than one is optional
