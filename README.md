This is a solver for subgraph isomorphism (induced and non-induced) problems.

Compiling

You need golang 1.22.3

``
$ go build -o output_name 
``

Testing

``
$ go test
``

Running

To run:
``
$ ./output_name -flags dir1 dir2 
``

will find subgraph isomorphisms of the graph dir2 inside dir1

Default output to directory "dat/"

We use python 3 for the python scripts, these were created along the way to help formatting, and create the ordering.
To create an ordreing the simplest way is to use new_script with the full_pipeline() function. that takes input graphs as json files, parses them to networkx,
from that creates our optimal ordering, and outputs that into an appropriate json file.

File Format

For the json grpah: node - link data json file (like the one generated by networkx), and only numerical values. node id's - uint64, color id's - uint32.
For the folder based graphs: a directory with 2 files (or more, will be ignored) ending with .edges, .node_labels respectivly. specify parse flag to indicate how to format the data in those files
