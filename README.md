This is a solver for subgraph isomorphism (induced and non-induced) problems.

Compiling

You need golang 1.22.3
``
$ go build -o output_name 
``
Testing

runs tests on gnps, with very low probability a test would fail (because there are random graphs), thus sometimes rerunning can verify the result
``
$ go test
``
Running

To run:
``
$ ./outputname i j 
``

will find subgraph isomorphisms of graphj.json inside graphi.json, given the ordering ordering_i_j.json

Outputs to directory "dat/"
And Expectes inputs to be inside "inputs/"

And python 3 for the python scripts, that we created along the way to help formatting, and create the ordering
to create the ordreing the simplest way is to use new_script with the full_pipeline() function. that takes input json, parses them to networkx
from that creates the ordering and outputs that into an appropriate json file

File Format
node - link data json file (like the one generated by networkx), and only numerical values. node id's - uint32, color id's - uint16 
the ordering should be {ordering : []} json where the array is an the choice for v1,v2... you need at least one to work. but more then 1 is optional
